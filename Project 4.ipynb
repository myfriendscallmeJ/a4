    "\n",
    "Nine years ago, just a few days before Christmas at the midpoint in the 2010/11 season, football commentator Andy Gray gave the football lexicon a small but lasting gift. He and Richard Keys were filling the time before kickoff in the televised Monday night match discussing the relative merits of two of the greatest players of all time, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo who were going head-to-head for yet another award.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depsite being full of praise for Messi, who played (and still does) for Barcelona in Spain's La Liga, Gray suggested the player many believe the best to play to play the game \"would struggle on a cold night at the Britannia Staidium\"$^{1}$, where Stoke City play their home games. For Stoke, it appeared a relatively generous assertion given they were hardly one of the best sides in England, let alone Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quote morphed and took on a life of its own. \"Can he/they/she do it on a cold, rainy night in Stoke\" has became a sometimes serious, often tongue-in-cheek benchmark for quality, especially in unfamiliar or unpleasant conditions even beyond the realm of football. SHowing how serious teh notion is sometimes taken, the Daily Telgraph named it one of the ten most enduring football debates,$^{2}$ while at the other end of the scale, the line even spawned its own video game.$^{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Stoke spent 10 seasons in the top flight before being relegated to the second tier of English football at the end of the 2017/18 season but the meme lives on. Recently when English side knocked Barcelona out of the European Champions League, many twitter users saw it as evidence that Messi could not in fact do it on a cold night in Stoke, setting aside the fact that Stoke and Liverpool are in fact different places (and Messi and his teammates have knocked plenty of English and Scottish sides out of the Champions League). Nonetheless it piqued our interest in the math behind the myth.\n"
